// This is the bug that regressed three times: the self-greet must play in the
// live-capture steady state (AFTER getUserMedia resolves) and the self-farewell
// must play while the mic is still live (BEFORE the track is stopped). Playing
// either one in the capture start/stop device transition clips/drops it. We
// don't test audio output here (no Web Audio in node) — we record a timeline of
// the relevant events and assert their relative order, which is the invariant
// that broke. See voice.js for the full reasoning.
