# rivendell — project guide for Claude Code

Small self-hosted chat server (~20 friends). Single Go binary + Postgres + vanilla-JS client.
Owner is technical, privacy-minded; forthright answers, no hand-holding.

## Prime directive: zero new dependencies

**Backend: exactly one third-party module — `github.com/lib/pq`. Everything else is stdlib.**
**Frontend: zero runtime deps.** Do not add an HTTP router, WebSocket lib, password lib,
migration tool, or frontend framework. If a task seems to need a dep, stop and propose it first.
Some choices were forced by the build environment — removing them is not a free win.

Module path `rivendell`; Go 1.26. Imports `rivendell/internal/...`.

## Build, test, run

- `make build` / `make run` / `make migrate`
- `make test` — Go + frontend. `make test-go` / `make test-web` individually.
- `make fmt` / `make vet` — run both before finishing.

Always run `gofmt`, `go vet ./...`, `go test ./...` (with `TEST_DATABASE_URL`), and
`node --test web/test/*.test.js` before declaring work done. Add tests for new behavior.

## Environment quirks

- **Postgres is a container**, not a host service. No `pg_ctlcluster`. Dev creds:
  user `chat` / pw `chat_dev_pw` / dbs `chat` + `chat_test`.
  Test DB already running at port 55432: `TEST_DATABASE_URL='postgres://chat:chat_dev_pw@localhost:55432/chat_test?sslmode=disable'`
- **Go module proxy unreachable in build sandbox.** Use `go env -w GOPROXY=direct GOSUMDB=off GOFLAGS=-mod=mod`.
- **docker.io unreachable in sandbox** (`403`). `make podman-build` works with normal registry access.
- Run web tests as `node --test web/test/*.test.js` (directory arg is misinterpreted).
- **GitHub push:** `GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -i .creds/claude' git push origin <branch>`

## Conventions

- **List endpoints return `[]`, never `null`.** Use `out := []T{}`. `TestEmptyListsReturnArraysNotNull` guards this.
- **Bump `Version` in `internal/config/config.go`** (patch increment) with every meaningful commit to develop. Doc-only changes (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/`) don't need a bump — the `pre-commit` hook only auto-bumps when a source file (server code, web assets, Dockerfile, `go.mod`) is staged.
- Passwords: PBKDF2 format `pbkdf2-sha256$<iter>$<b64salt>$<b64key>`, 600k iterations. Don't lower.
- Roles: admin > moderator > member. Guard last-admin removal (`CountAdmins`).
- `channelVisibleTo` is the single visibility predicate — `audienceForChannel` and `canAccessChannel` both delegate to it.
  Private non-DM channels include all admins; DMs are strictly members-only.
- `users.status` is durable — `onPresenceChange` must **never** write it. `TestStatusDurableAcrossReconnect` guards this.
- Presence debounce (~1s, `schedulePresenceUpdate`) — don't "simplify" to immediate apply. Own user is exempt.
- `format.js`: escape first, then markdown pass. Links extracted *before* `inlineMarkup` — never refactor to linkify-last.
- `composer-richtext.js`: live composer decoration **mirrors** `format.js`'s inline rules (bold before italic, code pulled out first) — keep them in lockstep; the parity test guards it. Load-bearing invariant: `decorate` only WRAPS runs (markers kept, dimmed), never adds/removes a character, so `.value` stays the exact markdown source and the facade's text-offset caret math holds. The composer's `input` handler captures the caret offsets BEFORE its image-harvest/flatten mutations and threads them to `rich.onInput(start,end)` — those mutations destroy the live Selection but not the offsets.
  - **Decoration toggle is ORTHOGONAL to behavior.** `prefs.loadRichText()` (default ON, profile checkbox `#richtext-enable`) only controls whether markdown is *rendered styled*; Ctrl-B/I and undo/redo work either way. Don't re-couple them.
  - **Undo/redo is OURS, always-on.** Because both the decoration rewrite and Ctrl-B/I mutate the field programmatically (innerHTML / `.value`), the browser's native history is desynced and unreliable — so `createUndoHistory` (pure, unit-tested) replaces it wholesale and `handleKeydown` preventDefaults Ctrl/Cmd-Z, Cmd-Shift-Z, Ctrl-Y. Typing coalesces into word-ish steps; Ctrl-B/I and the URL-wrap paste (`rich.commit()`) are discrete steps. Any out-of-band `.value` set (channel switch, send-clear, error-restore) must call `rich.resetHistory()` so undo can't bridge that boundary.
- CSS: `[hidden] { display: none !important; }` must stay. Wire controls before `startRealtime()`.
- Frontend ES modules import siblings with **bare relative specifiers** (`./api.js`,
  no version suffix). Cache-busting is **path-based**: index.html loads the entry from
  `/v/<version>/static/app.js`, and relative imports keep every sibling under that same
  prefix, so one page load resolves each module to one URL = one instance (the
  single-instance guarantee for stateful modules like secret.js). The server strips
  `/v/<version>/` and serves the file raw + immutable (`handleVersionedStatic`); the
  `<version>` value is a pure cache key (ignored on read). A bump changes the prefix ⇒
  all module URLs change at once. Only index.html and sw.js still carry the
  `__RIVENDELL_VERSION__` token (templated at serve time). Guarded by the
  `TestVersioned*` / `TestIndexReferencesVersionedEntry` tests in `static_test.go`.

## Critical feature invariants (full rationale in docs/design.md and the per-subsystem notes alongside it)

**Voice/WebRTC**
- Offerer = lower user_id. Initial offer from `onVoiceState` only — `sendOffer` returns early while `!pc.remoteDescription`.
- Glare re-offer is ONE-SHOT (`renegotiatePending` flag). Do NOT wire to `signalingstatechange` or both peers oscillate.
- TURN credentials are **HMAC-SHA1**, not SHA256. `TestRTCCredentials` asserts 20-byte digest.
- Both `onconnectionstatechange` AND `oniceconnectionstatechange` feed `effectiveConnectionState`. Don't key on either alone.
- DM calls end for both parties (`endDMVoiceCall`/`cleanupVoiceForUser` removes both). `TestDMCallEndsForBothParties` guards.
- Video bitrate cap (800 kbps) is the per-sender CEILING; `bitrateCapFor(numPeers,"video")` shrinks it across senders as the roster grows. Per-peer AIMD congestion control (`monitorCongestion`/`congestionTarget`, every 2.5s) lowers the live target below that ceiling on remote-reported loss/RTT spikes OR a CPU-pinned local encoder (`uplinkStressed`), and climbs back only after `CLIMB_AFTER_HEALTHY` consecutive healthy intervals (`healthyStreak`) — the streak gate is the anti-oscillation fix, don't drop it to one sample. `applyVideoBitrateCaps(uid,pc)` applies the full encoding shape via `withVideoEncodingCaps`: `effectiveVideoCap` (maxBitrate) PLUS `videoScaleForTarget` (scaleResolutionDownBy/maxFramerate) — bitrate-only back-off does NOT relieve a CPU-bound phone encoder, only dropping resolution/framerate does. Stability mechanism, NOT a freeze fix — don't remove it.
- Group caps are server-enforced (`MaxVoiceAudio`/`MaxVoiceVideo`): over-cap join ⇒ `voice.join_denied{reason:"full"}` (abort); over the video sub-cap ⇒ forced video-muted + `reason:"video_full"` (audio-only). DMs are exempt. `TestVoiceJoinDeniedWhenFull`/`TestVoiceVideoSubCap` guard.
- Per-user volume uses `audio.volume`, not Web Audio GainNode (Chromium no-output bug with WebRTC+WebAudio).
- Teardown is synchronous (`finishTeardown` → `closeAllPeers` before farewell-tone await). `callGen` guards rapid re-join.
- **Screen share is a SECOND video SOURCE on the single video slot, mutually exclusive with the camera** (`setScreenShareEnabled`). Camera↔screen swaps the source on the existing m-line via `replaceTrack` (instant, no reneg); first-enable `addTrack`s and renegotiates. `contentHint="detail"` + `videoScaleForTarget(t, isScreen=true)` HOLD resolution and shed framerate (the inverse of the camera's motion trade — sheared text is worse than choppy). `track.onended` catches the browser's native "Stop sharing" bar and flips to video-off.
- Screen VIDEO parks its sender on stop (`replaceTrack(null)`, reused via `idleVideoSender`). **`idleVideoSender` must only match a transceiver already negotiated to SEND (`currentDirection` sendrecv/sendonly), never a recvonly RECEIVE slot** — else whoever turns their camera on SECOND in a 2-way call reuses the receive slot and silently never offers (the 2.0.0 regression). `dm-call`'s sequential-camera spec guards it.
- Screen AUDIO (Chrome tab/system audio) is `addTrack`ed INTO the mic's `localStream` so the remote groups both by msid and plays them through its one per-peer `<audio>`; it rides its OWN m-line, so muting the mic never silences it. Teardown FULLY removes it (`pc.removeTrack`, NOT park) — audio has no `video_muted`-style gate, so a parked-but-lingering track would still be heard. `web/e2e/screen-share` pins share→receive→camera-swap→teardown.

**Reactions**
- `message.update` that omits `reactions` must PRESERVE existing ones (`addMessage` guards this).
- `toggleReaction` takes the pill's known `mine` — do NOT regress to a `findMessage` lookup.

**Message-pane rendering**
- Realtime event repaints batch through `scheduleRender(...surfaces)` — one paint per task on a `setTimeout(0)`, **never `requestAnimationFrame`**: rAF is paused in a hidden tab, but the unread count in the document title must keep climbing while backgrounded. The synchronous load/jump/scroll paths (`loadChannel`/`jumpToMessage`/`resync`/`selectChannel`) bypass it and call the render fns directly (they measure scroll right after painting).
- `message.new` at the live tail appends ONE row (`appendMessageRow`); `reaction.update`/`message.update` swap the single touched row (`patchMessageRow`). Full `renderMessages()` (innerHTML wipe + rebuild) stays the source of truth for channel-open/jump/resync and the fallback when a row can't be patched (delete/system/secret/history/scrolled-up). The fast paths exist so a reader's text selection, in-flight images, and scroll survive live traffic — don't route live events back through the full render.
- `read.update` (including the self-echo from your own mark-read) and `markActiveChannelRead` must **NOT** full-render — they call `refreshReadMarks()` (👁 titles only). A full render there wipes the selection on every incoming message; the unread divider is local session state a remote read doesn't move. Guarded by `web/e2e/live-append.spec.js`.
- Sending is **optimistic**: `showOptimisticSend` paints a dimmed `pending` row (NEGATIVE temp id — can't collide with a server id) at the live tail before the POST; the message.new echo reconciles it in place via `reconcileOptimistic`, matched by `(channel, exact content)` because the server round-trips no client nonce (don't "simplify" the match to id — there is no shared id until the echo). A failed POST rolls it back (`removePending`) and restores the composer; a channel switch drops tracked rows (`clearPendingSends`). Optimistic only at the live tail — a history window / secret view keep their reload / secret paths. Guarded by `web/e2e/optimistic-send.spec.js`.

**Web Push**
- JWT signature is JOSE raw `r||s` (64 bytes), **never DER** — `SignASN1` silently breaks all pushes.
- `aud` recomputed per endpoint (scheme://host) — cached global `aud` rejected by Mozilla/Apple.
- Push only to disconnected users. Runs in goroutine — must never slow message send.

**Secret chat**
- Offerer = lower user_id. Sessions in JS memory only — never persisted.
- No fallback to weaker crypto primitives — ever.
- Server relays `secret.*` WS frames opaque, same DM-membership validation as voice.
- UI/UX lives in `secretui.js` (banner, 🔒 button, safety modal); `secret.js` owns the
  crypto/session state. Identity key is published at boot (idempotent) so any peer can be
  offered a session — an offer needs the peer's key already published. `web/e2e/secret-chat`
  pins offer→accept→matching safety number across two browsers.

**Uploads / blobs**
- Content type sniffed with `http.DetectContentType`, never trusts header.
- Hash is 64-char lowercase hex; validated before use (path-traversal immunity).
- Writes are atomic (tmp + rename). Same bytes → same hash → one file (idempotent).

**Invitations vs magic links**
- `invitations` table is distinct from `magic_links`. Don't merge them.
- Account creation + invitation consumption are one transaction (`store.RedeemInvitation`).

**Link preview proxy: allowlist-only.** No *arbitrary-URL* server-side fetch — the proxy
(`preview.go`, route `GET /api/link-preview`) fetches OG tags (Wikipedia via its summary
API) only for hostnames on the allowlist: a hardcoded default set in `config.go`
(github/wikipedia/major news orgs), overridable via `RIVENDELL_LINK_PREVIEW_DOMAINS`;
`domainAllowed` matches subdomains too. A non-allowlisted or cache-errored URL gets a bare
`404` (`http.NotFound`, no JSON — the allowlist isn't leaked), which `api.getLinkPreview`
maps to a "no card" marker without throwing. An empty allowlist disables the feature.
YouTube + message-permalink embeds are client-side only and were intentionally kept.
SSRF hardening (`newPreviewClient`): the outbound fetch client refuses to dial any
non-public IP (loopback/RFC1918/ULA/link-local incl. the 169.254.169.254 metadata
endpoint) via a `net.Dialer.Control` hook — vetting the resolved IP at connect time, so
DNS rebinding can't bypass it — AND re-applies the https + `domainAllowed` checks on
**every** redirect hop, not just the entry URL, so an allowlisted host's open redirect
can't pivot the fetch off-allowlist or inward. The allowlist alone is enforced once, at
the door; these two guards keep it true end-to-end. Guarded by `TestIsPublicIP`,
`TestCheckPreviewRedirect`, `TestPreviewClientRefusesInternal`.
